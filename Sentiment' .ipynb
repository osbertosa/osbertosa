To my shock once plugged in, the two satellite speakers produce a audible hissing noise when the unit is turned on. I disconnected the speakers from my sound card and computer but the hissing noise remained. This told me the source of the noise was coming from inside the unit itself. Even with the speaker volume turned down its lowest setting the hiss is still audible at my normal speaker placement of a yard+ away. I moved the speakers away from my monitor and any other possible source of interference but the noise remained.The music playback with the speakers is excellent. The sound is rich but not over powered by the subwoofer. But again you can still hear the hissing noise with soft music play back.All in all I am very disappointed with this product.'"
